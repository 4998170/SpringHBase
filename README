HBase is a popular NoSQL database based on Google's BigTable. It's integral part of Hadoop family of projects. More about HBase can be found at http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/

At GumGum we created Spring Template for accessing HBase in java way back in 2009. I also filled an issue in Spring Framework's jira (https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-5950) hoping that Spring will integrate our code in their libraries. But since that hasn't happened yet, I decided to open source the code here so that the community can benefit.

The code here will work with HBase 0.92.x. If you want to make it work with earlier versions a small change might be required. 
Contact me at vpuranik at gmail to get the code working on prior Hbase versions. Alternatively you can use the code posted in the jira issue mentioned above. That code 
is tested on 0.90.x and 0.20.x versions.

The code can be built with gradle. Gradle is like maven or ant + dependency management. You can install gradle from http://www.gradle.org/.
Once gradle is install, simply run gradle clean assemble from the folder where build.gradle file is located. It will create a build folder 
and under build/libs folder you will find the jar. Simply include this jar in your your application. You are also required to include HBase 0.92.x
and Hadoop Core (any version after 0.20.2) jars since the code the source depends upon those jars.

You may alternatively choose to include the source code in your project and build it with your source code. In that case just make sure that 
HBase and Hadoop jars are in the compile classpath.
